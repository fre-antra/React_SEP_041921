        <p class="post-content">Millions of Americans are not getting the second doses of their Covid-19 vaccines, and
          their ranks are growing.</p>
        <hr>

        <p class="post-content">More than five million people, or nearly 8 percent of those who got a first shot of the
          Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, have missed their second doses, according to the most recent data from the Centers
          for Disease Control and Prevention. That is more than double the rate among people who got inoculated in the
          first several weeks of the nationwide vaccine campaign.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Even as the country wrestles with the problem of millions of people who are wary about
            getting vaccinated at all, local health authorities are confronting an emerging challenge of ensuring that
            those who do get inoculated are doing so fully.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="post-content">The reasons vary for why people are missing their second shots. In interviews, some said
          they feared the side effects, which can include flulike symptoms. Others said they felt that they were
          sufficiently protected with a single shot.</p>

        <h2>Heading</h2>

        <p class="post-content">Those attitudes were expected, but another hurdle has been surprisingly prevalent. A
          number of vaccine providers have canceled second-dose appointments because they ran out of supply or didnâ€™t
          have
          the right brand in stock.</p>

        <h3>Sub-heading</h3>

        <p class="post-content"><a href="#" class="post-link">Walgreens</a>, one of the biggest vaccine providers, sent
          some
          people who got a first shot of
          the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to get their second doses at pharmacies that only had the other vaccine on hand.

        </blockquote>

        <p class="post-content">Several Walgreens customers said in interviews that they scrambled, in some cases with
          help from pharmacy staff, to find somewhere to get the correct second dose. Others, presumably, simply gave
          up.

        </ul>

        <p class="post-content">From the outset, public health experts worried that it would be difficult to get
          everyone
          to return for a second shot three or four weeks after the first dose. It is no surprise that, as vaccines are
          rolled out more broadly, the numbers of those skipping their second dose have gone up.</p>

          <li>asdf</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="post-content">There is no way to know for sure whether the vaccine triggered the headache. But after
          weighing what he saw as the risks and benefits of a second dose, Dr. Ish-Shalom reached a decision about how
          to
          proceed.</p>
