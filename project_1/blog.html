              Curd rice, also called yogurt rice, is a dish originating from
              India. The word "curd" in Indian English refers to unsweetened
              probiotic yogurt. It is most popular in the South Indian states of
              Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala , Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra
              Pradesh.

              In the state of Maharashtra it is known as dahi bhat. In the state
              of Tamil Nadu it is called thayir saadam, in Kerala it is called
              "tayire choore" and in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh it is called
              perugannam/daddojanam. In Karnataka, it is called mosaranna. The
              dish is a staple of traditional cuisine, with the untempered
              version present at the end of almost every South Indian meal. The
              tempered version is often served during formal occasions and also
              offered as prasadam (blessed food) to devotees in temples.

          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <p>
            While it is most easily prepared by simply mixing steamed white rice
            and yogurt, more elaborate methods can be used when needed.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Rice is prepared either via steaming or pressure cooking to be
              soft as in the South Indian style
            </li>
            <li>It is then allowed to cool to room temperature</li>
            <li>
              After which it is seasoned with finely chopped green chillies,
              ginger, and curry leaves
            </li>
            <li>
              And sometimes along with the tempering of black gram, mustard
              seeds, cumin seeds, and asafoetida
            </li>
            <li>Finally, curd and salt are added</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Serving</h2>
          <p>
            Curd rice is often eaten accompanied by South Asian pickles. In
            South Indian cuisine, curd rice is traditionally eaten at the end of
            lunch and dinner, as this helps ease the effects of spicy food
            consumed prior. It is also said to aid digestion, as well as to
            balance the effects of the warm climate.
